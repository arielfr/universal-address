# Universal address

Giving solutions to addressing the world

## Inspiration

Sadly, in the world what we are living we have many disasters and problems around the world. For instance, disasters like floods, earthquakes, wars, and so many others obly people to evacuate their homes. In that situations, people and organtizations around the world want help sending medicines, food, clothes, and other things, but, what is the 'address' of those people? In many situations, they do not have an address, and that simple problem is actually a big problem. That's only an example, but there are many others example, like people living in Africa who they are just living in someplace without any address.

**Universal Addreess* project's aim is *addressing the world*, so we would love to provide an *universal address (UA)* for every place in the world. We also want a easy way to know what is my UA and how to locate an UA on a map. To acomplish all our objectives, we chose a very popular and easy to use Facebook tool, the *Facebook Messenger*. We created a Chat Bot that allows you to create an UA based on some location and also translating UA to geolocations on a map. It seems cool, right? Let's get continue and we will provide further information about our bot :)
